## 🚀 Quick Start

### Download Data
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gitdot5/excavator-pin-dimensions.git

# Navigate to data directory
cd excavator-pin-dimensions/data
```

### Import into Excel/Google Sheets
1. Download `excavator_database.csv`
2. Open in Excel or Google Sheets
3. Use "Import" or "Open" function
4. Select CSV format with comma delimiter

### Use with Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the database
df = pd.read_csv('excavator_database.csv')

# Find specific manufacturer
caterpillar_models = df[df['Manufacturer'] == 'Caterpillar']

# Search by pin diameter
large_excavators = df[df['Stick_Pin_Diameter_mm'] >= 80]

# Filter by model year (2019-2024)
new_models = df[df['Data_Source'].str.contains('New_2024')]
```

## 🔍 Search Examples

### Find Models by Pin Size
```python
# Mini excavators (< 50mm pin)
mini_excavators = df[df['Stick_Pin_Diameter_mm'] < 50]

# Medium excavators (50-80mm pin)
medium_excavators = df[(df['Stick_Pin_Diameter_mm'] >= 50) & 
                      (df['Stick_Pin_Diameter_mm'] < 80)]

# Large excavators (80mm+ pin)
large_excavators = df[df['Stick_Pin_Diameter_mm'] >= 80]
```

### Find by Manufacturer
```python
# Japanese manufacturers
japanese_brands = ['Komatsu', 'Hitachi', 'Kubota', 'Takeuchi', 'Kobelco']
japanese_models = df[df['Manufacturer'].isin(japanese_brands)]

# European manufacturers
european_brands = ['Volvo', 'Liebherr', 'JCB', 'Mecalac', 'Atlas']
european_models = df[df['Manufacturer'].isin(european_brands)]
```
